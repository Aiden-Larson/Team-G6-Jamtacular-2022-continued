# Using the Map Editor

## Creating a Map
- Clicking on and keeping the mouse over the "RGB", "PROP", "PICKUP" or "ENEMY" buttons allows the user to type the name of an entity into that field (e.g. "255,255,255" or "pillar"). With one of these selected, left-clicking the mouse can be used to place these entities on the map.

- Clicking on the entrance/exit buttons allows the user to place map entrance/exit points.

- Right clicking erases blocks.

## Importing Files
### Command-line (Windows & UNIX)
```bash
./mapedit [FILE]
```
Where [FILE] is the filepath to a .map file. If supplied, the .map file will be imported into the map editor.

### GUI (Windows)
On Windows, .map files can be dragged onto the mapedit executable to import them into the editor.
